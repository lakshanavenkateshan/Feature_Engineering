# Feature Engineering  

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that better represent the underlying problem to predictive models. It improves model accuracy, interpretability, and performance.

## **Overview**  
- **Data Pre-processing**  
- **Feature Selection**  
- **Encoding Techniques**

## **Data Pre-processing**  
Data pre-processing is the first step to ensure that the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for modeling.  
- Handling missing values  
- Removing duplicates  
- Outlier detection and treatment  
- Data normalization and standardization

## **Feature Selection**  
Feature selection helps identify and retain the most important features while reducing dimensionality.  
- Filter methods (Correlation, Chi-square test, ANOVA)  
- Wrapper methods (Forward selection, Backward elimination, RFE)  
- Embedded methods (Lasso, Ridge, Decision Trees, Random Forest feature importance)

## **Encoding Techniques**  
Encoding categorical data is crucial to convert non-numeric values into numeric representations for ML algorithms.  
- **Label Encoding**: Assigns unique numbers to each category  
- **Ordinal Encoding**: Encodes categories with an order/rank  
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Creates binary columns for each category  
- **Frequency Encoding**: Encodes categories based on frequency counts

## **Conclusion**  
Feature engineering bridges the gap between raw data and machine learning models. By applying proper pre-processing, feature selection, and encoding techniques, we can build efficient and robust predictive systems.
